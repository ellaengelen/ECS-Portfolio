    <p>I love lacrosse so much and I am so excited to share my passion with you. I have been doing it for a long time. I have been doing it for almost 2 years and it has changed my life completely <p/>
    
    <h2>How I Started<h2/>
      <h4> I first started playing Lacrosse in the spring season of 7th grade, and have been loving it ever since. I have played lacrosse for almost 2 years now. I got into lacrosse through my cousin, who was an All-star lacrosse player at Maryland. He played alongside the best lacrosse players in the country, and was also very good at lacrosse. My brothers started following his example, playing lacrosse avidly despite it not being common in Utah. I initially didn't want to start, I wanted to stick with soccer. I am so thankful that my dad pushed me into playing, and I have never regretted that decision ever. Lacrosse means a lot to me, and I hope I can share that love with you!<h4/>
        
        
      <h2> Spotlight: My Dad <h2/>
        <h4> Many people contributed to me playing this sport. My cousin, my coaches, my teammate. I even convinced some of my friends to play! But who I want to put the spotlight on is my dad. He is the reason I am playing now even if he doesn't understand it! <h4/>

      <h2> History of Lacrosse <h2/>
        <h4> Lacrosse actually began in North America, in Canada and the United States. Early Native Americans played the game barefoot, with no equipment and a loose set of rules. There were hundreds of players on the field at the time. European settlers established more stringent rules for the sport. Lacrosse evolved in Canada, where it was named the national sport in 1859. In 1867, George Beers, a Montreal dentist, wrote the sport's first rulebook. This means a lot to me because it was originally started in our country,and part the historic culture of America. I feel very proud to play the sport<h4/>
          
   <h2> How to Play <h2/>
     <h4> I play girls lacrosse, which is a little different than boys. We can't hit each other's sticks, only making contact with our hands or body. We also have a less deep stick pocket, making it harder to catch and shoot. But the basic rules are;
       <ul>
         <li> Equipment: Lacrosse Goggles, Mouthguard, Stick </li>
         <li> There is a 12 meter, 8 meter (defenders can only be in here for 3 seconds if they are not on a girl, and crease (Goalie circle that nobody can go into). </li>
         <li> There are 3 sections of the field. Attack, Midfield, and Defensive zones. There are 12 players on the field at a time. Attack can't go into Defense, Defense can't go into attack. Midfielders can go anywhere, anyone can go into the midfield </li>
         <li> No contact with your stick, only your hands and body </li>
         <li> 12-inch invisible "sphere" around each girl's head that nobody can put their stick in</li>
         <li> If there is a foul, girls can shoot from the 8 meters </li>
         <ul/>
         <h4/>
