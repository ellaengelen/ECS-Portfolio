              <p> I am a competitive lacrosse player, and am on various competitive teams and the Skyline Girls Lacrosse Team. I also am a skier! 
              I love skiing and was on Alta's All Mountain team. I love being in the outdoors like hiking and biking! Along with this I like to 
              photograph the nature I hike or ski in. The picture on the home page was done by me! I am also a budding artist, and like to paint
              and draw when I can. Reading is also a passion of mine, my favorite book being "Boys in the Boat" </p>
